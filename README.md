# Texas A&M Men's Water Polo — Static Site

This is a static HTML/CSS site recreated from the team's Wix site so it can be hosted anywhere (GitHub Pages, Netlify, etc.).

## Structure
- `index.html` — landing page
- `about.html`, `scores.html`, `a-team.html`, `b-team.html`, `officers.html`, `coaches.html`, `photos.html`, `donate.html`
- `assets/styles.css`, `assets/script.js`

## Notes
- Player/staff images are linked to the Wix CDN (static.wixstatic.com). You may later download them and serve locally under `assets/img/` if preferred.
- Photo links point to SmugMug/Google Photos galleries.
- Update rosters/scores by editing the HTML tables/blocks directly.

## Hosting
- **GitHub Pages**: push this folder to a repo and enable Pages on the `main` branch.
- **Netlify**: drag‑and‑drop the folder at https://app.netlify.com/drop
- **Any static host**: point the web root to this folder.
